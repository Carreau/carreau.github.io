<p>Hi, I'm Matthias. You may not here it while reading this, but I have a relatively
strong French <em>Akeussent</em>. </p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-like-to-be-known-for">What do you like to be known for ?</h2>
<p>I mostly like to be known for writing tools that get out of your way. Which is a
bit of a bummer as as a Scientist I'm mostly judged on my publications while I
prefer to enable others to do their work more efficiently and give them ideas. </p>
<p>One of the software I'm the most proud of is <a href="https://ipython.org">IPython</a>, I
did not create it, <a href="https://fperez.org">Fernando</a> did, but I think the current
version I maintain with <a href="https://github.com/takluyver">Thomas</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/minrk">Min</a> is one of the best tools for Python programmers
and Python scientist since Slice Bread. </p>
<p>IPython is also the canonical kernel implementation for
<a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>, and the jupyter notebook. I'm really happy to
have written a large part of the notebook codebase, and I'm quite happy with a
lot of small details in the notebook UI that just go out of your way and make
do the right thing. I know that most people don't notice, so I'm pretty happy
when people like <a href="https://github.com/wesm">Wes McKinney</a> do comments during
their tutorial like "I don't know who implemented that, but thank you".</p>
<h2 id="whats-you-background">What's you background ?</h2>
<p>My story is a little unusual. You probably don't know much about the French
education System, and even if you did I went through a pretty complicated path.
I went to what is called "Classes Préparatoires", where I learn Physics,
Chemistry, Engineering, Math, and a bit of Computing. (PCSI, PC* if you want to
know). I really enjoyed being challenged and trying to solve the problems I knew
I did not knew the answers to. (When you know you know the answer it's kinda
demotivating). </p>
<p>I got accepted to ENS-Cachan, where I learned a lot about experimental physics
and in a lesser way chemistry. Got really interested in Particle Physics, and
quantum mechanics, ended up doing an internship at SLAC, alone in front of a
computer from 4 month. It was enough to convince me that I definitively do not
want to write software in a corner to be potentially published a few years
later. I prefer to have something I can control (or at least comprehend) mostly
and have is more at human-scale. So I changed my way to Fluid Mechanics (in
which I got my Master Degree).</p>
<p>In the meantime I took the equivalent of a sabbatical year and passed the
"Agrégation of Physics". According to wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In France, the agrégation (French pronunciation: [aɡʁeɡasjɔ̃]) is the most
prestigious and selective civil service competitive examination for the
public education system. The laureates are known as agrégés, an the
candidates agrégatifs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More practically at least in my case, it was a year were I had a chance to no
only learn in depth about a wide range of subject in Physics, Electronic and
Chemistry but also gain knowledge about their history, and how they are taught. </p>
<p>I ended up becoming a laureate of Aggregation, if that have any meaning, but
having the chance to have an exam where the subject is 3 words "measure in
physics" and have 4 hours to not only come up with a 1h lecture and experiments
was probably one of the best and worse at the same time experience of my life.</p>
<p>After that I ended up stating a PhD in biophysics. Basically messing up with my
own microscope, lasers, and cell component to measure mechanical properties of
stuff (Actin gels mechanics, you can read it
<a href="http://matthiasphd.herokuapp.com/">here</a> if you like). Having a relatively
controlled experiment where I could influence almost anything from the raw
material to the end product and the processes used all along the pipeline was
great. That approximatively here that I realized that a large part that is
missing in science is people that know how and care to builds good tools. I
ended up graduating after 3 years, but that's not the most interesting part of
my PhD. </p>
<p>Early on, (end of 2010), I started to use and contribute to IPython. Having a
non-negligible background in messing up with computers, I realized that matlab
was not the best choice to manage and maintain my custom tooling for 3 years, so
I decided to refactor thing in Python with was not yet my language of choice,
but close to what I though would be a great fit.</p>
<p>I got involved with IPython, and starting to contribute regular
improvement/fixes as I encountered them on my day to day workflow. While the
initial time to spend writing good, modular, tested code (and spending the time
to contribute fixes upstream) looked like a large chunck of time, it ended up
being beneficial in the long run. I was able in the last third of my PhD to run
analysis or test hypothesis in a mater of hours instead of days, by still
performing experiment. </p>
<p>My involvement with IPython allowed me to become a core developer, travel to UC
Berkeley, and attend a couple of conferences (like SciPy), I would not have
attended otherwise. This made me aware of how the tools I was developing for
mostly myself had impact on thousand of people. I understood better that if I
spend an hour making 60 scientist do their job 1 minute faster, then my global
impact on Science is positive. </p>
<p>Also right now my background is beige for the top half of the wall. </p>

<p>I joined the IPython project as a Core developer during the early day of my PhD
in 2011. I helped it evolved from an interactive Command line interface into the
full feature web-based notebook interface which is now known as the broader
Project Jupyter and used by millions of user and help a large range of
discovery. I am happy to have played played a key role in many of the current
design. One of my key insight was developing nbconvert and host it as nbviewer,
a service allowing to view online Jupyter notebook that grew to more than 100k
visit a week, and is now integrated into well known platform like GitHub,
FigShare, Authorea, and a growing number of publishing platform. </p>
<p>Developing tools in particular as open-source make it hard to collect direct
metrics. As users of the tools can install it from the freely available and
redistributable source code there is no download count. As these tools are also
widely use in sensitive environment they do not use beacons to signal their
usage nor require a license key, so usage is hard to track. It's also relatively
rare to see software cited in a paper. Tools like <code>depsy.org</code> try to
aggregate software impact as one metric and put IPython  in the 100\%
percentile. We can also use various proxy measures to understand that tools I
developed have impact in all disciplines, in education, and in industry.</p>
<h4 id="jupyter-notebooks-on-github">Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub</h4>
<p>There are approximatively 800,000 jupyter notebooks publicly <a href="https://github.com/search?q=cell+extension%3Aipynb">available on
GitHub</a>.
I collaborated with GitHub to provide rendering of notebooks in 2015, which are
now first class citizen to be available for their 12 Million users.</p>
<h4 id="user-base">User Base</h4>
<p>The user base of the Jupyter Notebook and IPython is estimated to be 5 Million
User, with respectively 160,000 , and 420,000 download for the month of February
2017. </p>
<h4 id="jupyter-known-deployments">Jupyter known deployments</h4>
<p>The Jupyter notebook can be deployed at scale in a variety of context ranging
from small teams in research laboratory, to several hundreds in industry and
education. While I do not have exact number of deployments, there exists a number
of well known public deployments:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC Berkeley, is serving a campus-wide curriculum in Data Science with about
  800 students and is scheduled to scale to the entire incoming freshman class
  every year.</li>
<li>Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and the Bryn Mawr College are teaching a couple of
  classes using Jupyter/IPython.</li>
<li>At Lawrence Berkeley National lab, the National Energy Research Scientific
  Computing Center (NERSC), as a gateway to supercomputing resources available
  to over 5,000 researchers who use the facilities.</li>
<li>Part of the Data analysis platform at CERN provide a deployment for CERN
  Scientist</li>
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation, has a public deployment of Jupyter notebooks that
  can be access with any Wikipedia/Wikimedia user and have direct access to the
  Wikimedia datasets. </li>
<li>Anybody with a Microsoft account can access https://notebooks.azure.com which
  provides a Jupyter environment</li>
<li>IBM Data Scientist Workbench is integrated with Jupyter</li>
<li>Multiple companies from the Fortune 100 deploy Jupyter at the center of their
  data science and analytics departments</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nbviewer">Nbviewer</h4>
<p>The Jupyter project now host the NbViewer service (nbviewer.juyter.org) I
developed and provides it as an online service to render notebook for easy
sharing. As of February 2017 the monthly page view is about 800k for 300k single
user. Nbviewer is at the base of many further improvement of the Jupyter
platform and is at the base of many of the Jupyter usage developed in next
section.</p>
<h4 id="remarkable-uses-of-jupyteripython">Remarkable uses of Jupyter/IPython</h4>
<p>Following are a couple of example showing how the tools I develop are
influencing publishing, and the publication workflow.</p>
<p><strong>The discovery of gravitation waves</strong> at the beginning of 2016 by the LIGO
interferometer was stunning. A surprise of this discovery was that it was
accompanied by a set of Jupyter notebook to reproduce the analysis pipeline.
Their notebook can be viewed on nbviewer, or run on binder</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic Programming &amp; Bayesian Methods for Hackers</strong> is a book that was
initially publish on the online nbconvert platform, got a large success, and is
now available as a hard cover book.</p>
<p><strong>Regex golf</strong> is a Jupyter notebook by Peter Norvig that initially appeared
early after on the nbviewer platform I developed, after several years of efforts
it lead to the development of O Reill'y Oriole, where the original regex golf
example can be live edited and execute in the browser along a video explanation
by Peter Norvig himself.</p>
<p><strong>Nature cover highlight</strong> and accompanying live demo. In November 2014 Nature
News published "Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code" featuring Interviews
and a live interactive notebook, hosted on nature.com and showing the potential
to make executable academic publications. This demo broke the traffic
estimate from the nature editor and served more than 20,000 notebook in the
first moth post publication.</p>
